With a focused appeal, and an immediate, addictive set of mechanics, this is (probably) the best PSP Mini game to date. 8/10.

Monsters (Probably) Stole My Princess! is a wonderfully unique and well presented title, the presentation is wonderful, the action fast paced and the experience is an addictive one. There really are so many quality Minis titles out there already, however, this is easily one of the best and is highly recommended. 9/10

Monsters (Probably) Stole My Princess is a perfect distillation of the aims of Sony's Minis range - small in size, fun and addictive. 8/10
